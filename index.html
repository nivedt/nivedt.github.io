        <h1>Variables,expressions and statements</h1>
        <p>Hey there! This is me introducing to my first blog, here I will give you a glimpse of what variables, expressions and statements are in python. <br> Variable is a fundamental concept in python. It is a place where we can store values. Instead of using the values directly, we can refer to the variable name 
             where the actual values are stored.<br> It is a reserved memory location that stores and manipulates data. We have different data types of variables, the rules for naming variables in Python. The values belong to different types: 25 is an integer, and “Hey World!” is a string, so-called because it contains a “string” of letters. These can be identified as strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
             <br><br>
            <b>Example</b> <br>
             > x = 2 === > here X is Variable <br>
             > name = 'nived' === > here NAME is variable <br><br>
            
            The expression contains values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions<br> need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the<br> expression and displays the result.<br><br>
             
             <b>Example</b>
             > 25
             > x
             > y = x + 25<br><br>
            
            A statement is a logical unit of code that can be executed at the Python interpreter. When we<br> type a statement at the command prompt, it will execute the code in the statement then<br> provides the results, as long as the code is clean. We can execute code that is in a file. In<br> general, these file contains scripts, these scripts are a combination of statements to perform<br> units of work.<br><br>
             
             <b>Example</b><br>
             > print("Hey there!!")<br>
             Hey there!!<br>
